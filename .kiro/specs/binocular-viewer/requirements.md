# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates an interactive static website that simulates looking through binoculars at a background image (strategy.png). Users will see a circular viewport that reveals a portion of the background image, and they can navigate around the image using mouse movement or keyboard controls. The website will be deployable to GitHub Pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to see a binocular-style circular view of the background image, so that I can experience an immersive viewing effect.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL display a circular viewport showing a portion of the strategy.png background image
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL hide the areas outside the circular viewport with a dark overlay or mask
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the circular viewport SHALL be centered on the screen initially
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the background image SHALL be properly scaled and positioned behind the viewport

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to move the binocular view around the image using my mouse, so that I can explore different parts of the background image.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user moves their mouse THEN the system SHALL move the circular viewport to follow the mouse position
2. WHEN the mouse reaches the edge of the viewable area THEN the system SHALL constrain the viewport to stay within the background image boundaries
3. WHEN the user moves the mouse smoothly THEN the viewport movement SHALL be smooth and responsive without lag
4. WHEN the mouse is outside the browser window THEN the viewport SHALL remain at its last valid position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want to navigate the binocular view using keyboard controls, so that I can precisely explore the image without needing a mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user presses arrow keys THEN the system SHALL move the circular viewport in the corresponding direction
2. WHEN the user holds down an arrow key THEN the system SHALL continuously move the viewport in that direction
3. WHEN the viewport reaches the image boundary THEN the system SHALL stop movement in that direction
4. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the movement speed SHALL be consistent and controllable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website visitor, I want the website to work properly on different screen sizes, so that I can use it on various devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website loads on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL scale the circular viewport appropriately
2. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for navigation
3. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout accordingly
4. WHEN viewed on small screens THEN the circular viewport SHALL remain visible and functional

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the website to be deployable to GitHub Pages, so that it can be easily hosted and shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the website is built THEN the system SHALL consist only of static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2. WHEN deployed to GitHub Pages THEN the system SHALL load and function correctly
3. WHEN accessing the website THEN all assets SHALL load properly from the GitHub Pages domain
4. WHEN the repository is updated THEN the system SHALL support automatic deployment through GitHub Actions (optional)
