# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Set up basic HTML structure and project files

  - Create index.html with semantic HTML structure for the binocular container
  - Create styles.css and script.js files with basic boilerplate
  - Set up proper meta tags for responsive design and GitHub Pages compatibility
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.3_

- [x] 2. Implement background image display and container setup

  - Add CSS to display strategy.png as a full-screen background image
  - Implement proper image scaling and positioning to cover the entire viewport
  - Create the main binocular-container div with proper dimensions and overflow handling
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4_

- [x] 3. Create the circular viewport mask effect

  - Implement CSS clip-path circle mask for the binocular effect
  - Add dark overlay outside the circular area to simulate binocular view
  - Set initial viewport position to center of screen
  - Test and refine the visual appearance of the circular mask
  - **Testing**: Use `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to verify server is running, then view in browser
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 4. Implement basic mouse tracking and viewport movement

  - Add JavaScript event listener for mousemove events
  - Create ViewportController class to manage viewport position calculations
  - Implement smooth viewport movement that follows mouse cursor
  - Add boundary constraints to keep viewport within image bounds
  - **Testing**: Use `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to verify server, then test mouse movement in browser
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 5. Add keyboard navigation controls

  - Implement keydown and keyup event listeners for arrow key detection
  - Create continuous movement system for held-down keys using requestAnimationFrame
  - Add WASD key support as alternative to arrow keys
  - Implement proper key state management to handle multiple simultaneous key presses
  - **Testing**: Use `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to verify server, then test arrow keys and WASD in browser
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Implement responsive design and mobile support

  - Add CSS media queries for different screen sizes
  - Implement touch event handling for mobile devices
  - Create responsive viewport sizing that scales appropriately on different screens
  - Add orientation change handling and layout adjustments
  - **Testing**: Use `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to verify server, then test on different screen sizes and mobile devices
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Add performance optimizations and smooth animations

  - Implement event throttling for mouse movement to improve performance
  - Add CSS transitions for smooth viewport movement
  - Optimize DOM updates using CSS custom properties and transforms
  - Implement requestAnimationFrame for keyboard-based continuous movement
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Create error handling and browser compatibility features testing using localhost:8000 which is already running

  - Add image loading error handling with fallback messaging
  - Implement feature detection for clip-path support
  - Add graceful degradation for older browsers
  - Create loading states and user feedback for image loading
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 9. Implement final polish and GitHub Pages optimization testing using localhost:8000 which is already running

  - Optimize file structure and asset loading for GitHub Pages deployment
  - Add proper favicon and meta tags for social sharing
  - Document/update the README and explain the purpose of this simple site
